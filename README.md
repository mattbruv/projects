# projects

This is a repo which lists some of the projects I've worked on which I'm most proud of, along with details. I want to eventually make a projects page for my personal website which detail these, so this is temporary place for me to note down my projects for now.

## CCSR

https://github.com/mattbruv/ccsr

A modern port of the Shockwave game series Cartoon Cartoon Summer Resort. It also includes Scooby Doo Hollywood Horror Part 1 and Part 2, as well as a fully featured [map editor](https://github.com/mattbruv/ccsr/tree/main/map-o-matic-v2#map-o-matic-v2).

This is one of the projects I've been most proud of. It's my first project to reach 100 stars (soon), and it has brought a lot of joy to a lot of people who remembered this game and were able to play it again because of my effort. Many people have left messages of appreciation to have been able to play the game again, which has made this one of my most impactful projects to me personally.


## [BFBB Decompilation Project](https://github.com/bfbbdecomp/bfbb)

I have decompiled thousands of lines of source code to the game SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom for GameCube. Some of my proudest accomplishments with this project include decompiling the [full source code](https://github.com/bfbbdecomp/bfbb/blob/main/src/SB/Game/zNPCTypeBossSB1.cpp) of the cut boss fight [Robo-SpongeBob Musclepants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yODvosNKQBA), which had never been seen before my efforts.
I also wrote the [progress tracking website](https://bfbbdecomp.github.io/bfbb/) in React, which is built every time a commit is pushed to always give us the latest view into the project status.

## Lentokonepeli
https://github.com/mattbruv/Lentokonepeli

currently in process. Currently attempting to revive this lost multiplayer WW1 arieal dogfighting game. I'm writing the latest iteration in Rust + TypeScript. The latest iteration is not open source, but previous attempts at different stages of completion are open source in the provided repo.
This project is personal to me and many others (~60+ people waiting for it) because it was a fun game which connected many, and we spent a lot of time playing in the early 2000s back when Java applets were a thing.


## GameBoy Emulators

I wrote two emulators for the GameBoy, one in [C++](https://github.com/mattbruv/Gameboy-Emulator) and one in [Rust](https://github.com/mattbruv/Gameboy-Crust).

## MPLisp

A [LISP interpreter](https://github.com/mattbruv/mplisp) written in C++

## Quokka

A [UCI chess engine](https://github.com/mattbruv/Quokka) I wrote in C++ which plays at a respectable level (for a human, not a computer).

## Inferno Shoutbox

I ported the [Inferno Shoutbox](https://github.com/mattbruv/Inferno-Shoutbox?tab=readme-ov-file) to MyBB. This was done over a decade ago, and was one of my first public contributions to open source. Much to my recent surprise, [it still has active users to this day](https://community.mybb.com/thread-149231.html) who are commenting on the thread and people who maintain it. It was one of the two most popular and downloaded chat applicatioins for MyBB 1.6
